Retry on any error. This option is used together with --retry.

This option is the "sledgehammer" of retrying. Do not use this option by
default (eg in curlrc), there may be unintended consequences such as sending or
receiving duplicate data. Do not use with redirected input or output. You'd be
much better off handling your unique problems in shell script. Please read the
example below.

Warning: For server compatibility curl attempts to retry failed flaky transfers
as close as possible to how they were started, but this is not possible with
redirected input or output. For example, before retrying it removes output data
from a failed partial transfer that was written to an output file. However this
is not true of data redirected to a | pipe or > file, which are not reset. We
strongly suggest don't parse or record output via redirect in combination with
this option, since you may receive duplicate data.
