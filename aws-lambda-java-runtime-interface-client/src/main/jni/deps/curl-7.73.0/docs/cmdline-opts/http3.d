WARNING: this option is experimental. Do not use in production.

Tells curl to use HTTP version 3 directly to the host and port number used in
the URL. A normal HTTP/3 transaction will be done to a host and then get
redirected via Alt-SVc, but this option allows a user to circumvent that when
you know that the target speaks HTTP/3 on the given host and port.

This option will make curl fail if a QUIC connection cannot be established, it
cannot fall back to a lower HTTP version on its own.
